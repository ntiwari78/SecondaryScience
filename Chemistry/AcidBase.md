## 📘 Review Quiz (Short Answers)

Answer each in 2–3 sentences:

1. **What defines acids and bases in the Bronsted-Lowry concept?**
   → Acids donate H⁺, bases accept H⁺.

2. **How does the Lewis concept define acids and bases?**
   → Acids accept an electron pair; bases donate one.

3. **What’s the acidity trend among hydrocarbons and why?**
   → Alkynes > Alkenes > Alkanes; due to increasing s-character and bond polarity.

4. **Why are phenols more acidic than alcohols?**
   → Phenoxide ion is resonance-stabilized; alcohols lack this stabilization.

5. **How do -NO₂ groups affect carboxylic acid strength?**
   → They increase acidity by stabilizing the carboxylate ion via electron withdrawal.

6. **What is the effect of -CH₃ on phenol acidity?**
   → It donates electrons, destabilizing the phenoxide ion, reducing acidity.

7. **Explain the Ortho Effect in carboxylic acids.**
   → Ortho substituents enhance acidity due to steric hindrance disrupting resonance.

8. **Why are aliphatic amines more basic than aniline?**
   → Aniline’s lone pair is delocalized; ethylamine’s is readily available for bonding.

9. **What is the +I effect in amines?**
   → Alkyl groups donate electrons to nitrogen, increasing basicity.

10. **What is the Ortho Effect in aromatic amines?**
    → Ortho substituents reduce basicity via steric and electronic interference.

# Understanding Acids and Bases: The Two Fundamental Theories

## 📘 Introduction: What are Acidity and Basicity?

**Acidity** and **basicity** are fundamental chemical concepts that describe a substance's ability to **donate or accept protons** (H⁺) or **electron pairs**. These properties are essential for interpreting and predicting chemical reactions.

This guide explains the two major theories for defining acids and bases:

* The **[Brønsted–Lowry theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%B8nsted%E2%80%93Lowry_acid%E2%80%93base_theory)**
* The **[Lewis theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acids_and_bases)**

---

## 1. 🧪 The Brønsted-Lowry Theory: The Proton Exchange

The Brønsted–Lowry theory defines acids and bases in terms of **proton (H⁺) transfer**.

### 1.1. Brønsted-Lowry Acids: The Proton Donors

* A **Brønsted–Lowry acid** donates a proton (H⁺).
* Example: **[HCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid)** donates a proton to water in aqueous solution.

### 1.2. Brønsted-Lowry Bases: The Proton Acceptors

* A **Brønsted–Lowry base** accepts a proton (H⁺).
* Example: **[NH₃](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia)** accepts a proton to form NH₄⁺.

> **Learning Checkpoint:**
> In this theory, an **acid-base reaction** is the **transfer of a proton from acid to base**.

---

## 2. ⚛️ The Lewis Theory: The Electron Pair Exchange

The **Lewis theory** generalizes the concept by focusing on **electron pairs**, not just protons.

### 2.1. Lewis Acids: The Electron Pair Acceptors

* A **Lewis acid** accepts an electron pair.
* Example: **[BF₃](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_trifluoride)** acts as a Lewis acid by accepting an electron pair.

### 2.2. Lewis Bases: The Electron Pair Donors

* A **Lewis base** donates an electron pair.
* Example: **NH₃** donates an electron pair to form a bond with BF₃.

> **Learning Checkpoint:**
> The **Lewis theory** expands acid–base definitions to include **reactions without proton transfer**.

## 3. 🔬 Comparing the Theories: Protons vs. Electron Pairs

| **Feature**         | **Brønsted–Lowry Theory** | **Lewis Theory**         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Acid Definition** | Donates a proton (H⁺)     | Accepts an electron pair |
| **Base Definition** | Accepts a proton (H⁺)     | Donates an electron pair |

* **Lewis theory** is more **inclusive** and can explain reactions like the interaction between **BF₃ and NH₃**, which the Brønsted–Lowry theory cannot.

> Example:
> **NH₃** is a **base in both theories**:
> • Brønsted–Lowry: Accepts H⁺
> • Lewis: Donates an electron pair

---

## 4. ✅ Key Takeaways

* **Brønsted–Lowry**:

  * Acid: **Proton donor (H⁺)**
  * Base: **Proton acceptor (H⁺)**
  * Focus: **Proton transfer**

* **Lewis**:

  * Acid: **Electron pair acceptor**
  * Base: **Electron pair donor**
  * Focus: **Electron pair exchange**

These two definitions are essential for understanding **acid–base behavior in both inorganic and organic chemistry**, covering **reactions in aqueous solutions** and **non-aqueous systems**.
