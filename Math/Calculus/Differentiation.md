# Differentiation and Derivatives

**Differentiation** is a mathematical tool used to calculate small changes in a quantity with respect to another quantity.

The result of this process is called the **derivative**.

## Standard Notation

The standard notation for the derivative of a function, representing the change in $\( y \)$ with respect to $\( x \)$ , is:

$$
\[
\frac{dy}{dx}
\]
$$

## Applications: Instantaneous Rates of Change

Differentiation is commonly used to express **instantaneous rates of change**. Examples include:

- **Velocity** $(\( V \))$ : Defined as the change in position $(\( x \))$ with respect to time $(\( t \))$ .

$$
  \[
  V = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \approx \frac{dx}{dt}
  \]
$$

- **Acceleration** $(\( a \))$ : Defined as the change in velocity $(\( V \))$ with respect to time $(\( t \))$ .

$$
  \[
  a = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} \approx \frac{dV}{dt}
  \]
$$

- **General Rate of Change**:

$$
  \[
  \frac{dm}{dt}
  \]
$$

  This represents the change in $\( m \)$ with respect to time $\( t \)$.
