# Definition of a Sequence

In everyday life, the terms "[sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence)" and "[series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_%28mathematics%29)" are often used interchangeably to suggest a **succession of events or objects**, meaning an **ordered list**. Examples include:

* *A sequence of events*
* *A series of mathematics tests*
* *A cricket test match series*

However, in **mathematics**, **sequence** and **series** have separate technical meanings.

## Informal Definition

**Informally, a sequence is defined as an ordered list of numbers**. Examples include:

* Positive even integers: (2, 4, 6, 8, ...)
* Successive quotients when dividing 10 by 3 step-by-step: (3, 3.3, 3.33, ...)
* The numbers generated by the rabbit problem: [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

In an ordered list like *a₁, a₂, a₃, ...*, the order is important:

* *a₁* is the first member
* *a₂* is the second
* *a₃* is the third, and so forth

This emphasizes a **natural input-output arrangement** where:

* The place (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) acts as the input
* The number in that place (*a₁, a₂, a₃, ...*) is the output

## Formal Definition

**More formally, a real sequence is defined as a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29) from the set of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) to the set of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number)**.

A sequence is a function, say *f*, where:

* The **domain** is the set of natural numbers:
  $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$
* The **codomain** is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$

The terms of the sequence (*a₁, a₂, a₃, ...*) are the outputs or the **range** of this function.

For the term in the *n-th* place (*aₙ*), it is expressed as:

$$
f(n) = a_n
$$

**Example:**
The sequence of even positive integers (2, 4, 6, 8, ...) can be associated with the function:

$$
f(n) = 2n
$$

where the domain is $\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$.

It is customary to define a sequence as a function from $\mathbb{N}$, but it can also be defined from a **subset of natural numbers**, starting from some $n_0$ instead of 1. The definition also accommodates **finite sequences**.

## Finite and Infinite Sequences

* **Finite sequences:** Have a **finite number of terms**.
* **Infinite sequences:** Have an **infinite number of terms**.

Most discussions focus primarily on **infinite sequences**.

## Describing or Representing a Sequence

There are several ways to describe or represent a sequence:

1. ### Listing the Terms

   Writing out the terms in order:
   $a₁, a₂, a₃, ...$

2. ### Using a Rule for the nth Term (General Term)

   Providing a formula (usually in terms of *n*) to calculate any term:
   $a_n$

   **Example:**
   Even integers can be described by:
   $a_n = 2n$, for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$

3. ### Using a Recurrence Relation (Recursive Definition)

   Defining a term based on preceding terms.

   **Example:** The rabbit problem generates [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

$$
a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}, \quad \text{for} \ n \geq 2
$$

Initial terms must be specified for recursive definitions.

## Sequences vs. Sets

It is important to distinguish between a **sequence** and a **set**:

* **Order matters in a sequence**; in a set, the order of elements is not important.

  * Example:

    * Sequence: (2, 4, 6, 8, ...)
    * Different sequence: (4, 2, 8, 6, ...)
* **Elements can be repeated in a sequence**; in a set, repeated elements are not listed.

## Summary

While **informally** an ordered list, a **sequence** is **formally** a function mapping **natural numbers (or a subset)** to **real numbers**. This captures the essential characteristic of **order** and allows for different ways of description:

* **Rules (general terms)**
* **Recurrence relations**

This definition **distinguishes a sequence from a set**, where order and repetition follow different principles.

## Quiz Answer Key

1. In everyday life, "sequence" and "series" are often used interchangeably to mean a succession or ordered list of events or objects. In mathematics, they have distinct technical meanings.
2. Examples include saying "a sequence of events," "a series of mathematics tests," or "a cricket test match series."
3. "Succession" in this context means an ordered list or arrangement of events or objects.
4. The first example listed positive even integers as 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on, with the nth term being $2n$.
5. This example involves listing the successive quotients obtained when dividing 10 by 3 step-by-step (3, 3.3, 3.33, etc.), demonstrating an ordered list derived from a process.
6. The rabbit problem involves tracking the number of pairs of rabbits over time, where each pair of mature rabbits produces a new pair monthly. This generates the historically named [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
7. Informally, a sequence is defined as an ordered list of numbers.
8. More formally, a sequence is defined as a function where the domain is the set of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) (or a subset of natural numbers) and the codomain is typically the set of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number).
9. A sequence can also be described using a [recurrence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation), which defines a term based on the previous terms in the sequence.
10. A sequence is different from a set because **order matters** in a sequence, and elements can be repeated. In a set, the order of elements is not important, and elements are typically not listed repeatedly.
