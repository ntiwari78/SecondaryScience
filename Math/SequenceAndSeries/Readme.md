# Definition of a Sequence

In everyday life, the terms "[sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence)" and "[series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_%28mathematics%29)" are often used interchangeably to suggest a **succession of events or objects**, meaning an **ordered list**. Examples include:

* *A sequence of events*
* *A series of mathematics tests*
* *A cricket test match series*

However, in **mathematics**, **sequence** and **series** have separate technical meanings.

## Informal Definition

**Informally, a sequence is defined as an ordered list of numbers**. Examples include:

* Positive even integers: (2, 4, 6, 8, ...)
* Successive quotients when dividing 10 by 3 step-by-step: (3, 3.3, 3.33, ...)
* The numbers generated by the rabbit problem: [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

In an ordered list like *a₁, a₂, a₃, ...*, the order is important:

* *a₁* is the first member
* *a₂* is the second
* *a₃* is the third, and so forth

This emphasizes a **natural input-output arrangement** where:

* The place (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) acts as the input
* The number in that place (*a₁, a₂, a₃, ...*) is the output

## Formal Definition

**More formally, a real sequence is defined as a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29) from the set of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) to the set of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number)**.

A sequence is a function, say *f*, where:

* The **domain** is the set of natural numbers:
  $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$
* The **codomain** is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$

The terms of the sequence (*a₁, a₂, a₃, ...*) are the outputs or the **range** of this function.

For the term in the *n-th* place (*aₙ*), it is expressed as:

$$
f(n) = a_n
$$

**Example:**
The sequence of even positive integers (2, 4, 6, 8, ...) can be associated with the function:

$$
f(n) = 2n
$$

where the domain is $\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$.

It is customary to define a sequence as a function from $\mathbb{N}$, but it can also be defined from a **subset of natural numbers**, starting from some $n_0$ instead of 1. The definition also accommodates **finite sequences**.

## Finite and Infinite Sequences

* **Finite sequences:** Have a **finite number of terms**.
* **Infinite sequences:** Have an **infinite number of terms**.

Most discussions focus primarily on **infinite sequences**.

## Describing or Representing a Sequence

There are several ways to describe or represent a sequence:

1. ### Listing the Terms

   Writing out the terms in order:
   $a₁, a₂, a₃, ...$

2. ### Using a Rule for the nth Term (General Term)

   Providing a formula (usually in terms of *n*) to calculate any term:
   $a_n$

   **Example:**
   Even integers can be described by:
   $a_n = 2n$, for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$

3. ### Using a Recurrence Relation (Recursive Definition)

   Defining a term based on preceding terms.

   **Example:** The rabbit problem generates [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

$$
a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}, \quad \text{for} \ n \geq 2
$$

Initial terms must be specified for recursive definitions.

## Sequences vs. Sets

It is important to distinguish between a **sequence** and a **set**:

* **Order matters in a sequence**; in a set, the order of elements is not important.

  * Example:

    * Sequence: (2, 4, 6, 8, ...)
    * Different sequence: (4, 2, 8, 6, ...)
* **Elements can be repeated in a sequence**; in a set, repeated elements are not listed.

## Summary

While **informally** an ordered list, a **sequence** is **formally** a function mapping **natural numbers (or a subset)** to **real numbers**. This captures the essential characteristic of **order** and allows for different ways of description:

* **Rules (general terms)**
* **Recurrence relations**

This definition **distinguishes a sequence from a set**, where order and repetition follow different principles.
